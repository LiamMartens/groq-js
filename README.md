```javascript
import {parse, evaluate} from 'groq-js'

let input = '*[_type == "user"]{name}'

// Returns an ESTree-inspired syntax tree
let tree = parse(input)

let documents = [
  {_type: "user", name: "Michael"},
  {_type: "company", name: "Bluth Company"}
]

// Evaluate a tree against a set of documents
let result = await evaluate(tree, {documents})
